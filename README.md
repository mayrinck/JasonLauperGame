# Jason Lauper's Building Action

Public repository for POC & Alpha releases of the game Jason Lauper's Building Action. 

"What if you lived in a city full of criminals and a riot breaks out? What would you do? Jason decided to fight back!" - This is where the game story begins, Jason is just a guy with a gun and a lot of rage in his heart, seeking to punish every criminal he finds in his way until it's done. This is a game heavily inspired by games like Elevator Action and Metal Slug. Packed with a lot of what made 8-bit and 16-bit games fun. 

Our plan is to develop the game and publish it on Steam for a fair price when it's complete. As the project is still on a initial state, everything in the project can be changed and we have no release date so far. 


# Project Progress

We are currentily working on the basics right now... Mechanics, Enemies, Locations, Assets... Anything that can help us build the game. 
The first release is just a test of the core mechanics and engine. Expect A LOT of bugs.
